# Escape the Central Finite Curve!
![IMG_7583](https://github.com/kahlail/escape_the_central_finite_curve/assets/109074529/8bfae00e-2174-4f7a-b446-7a486b4b1ce8)

<p>A live dashboard for Eyepatch Morty, displaying all the data he needs to leave the Central Finite Curve! </p>


## The Problem

<p>Eyepatch Morty, our grey-area protagonist, is sick of his megalomanic, destructive and callous Grandpa - Rick and <strong>he wants out</strong>.
</p>


<p>Unfortunately for Eyepatch Morty, every universe is an instance where Rick exists as the smartest man in the universe... <em>Or so it would seem</em>.
</p>


<p>In order to escape the reach of Rick's across the multi-verse, Eyepatch Morty needs: <br/>

>â€¢ To acquire information about the Central Finite Curve, <br/>
>
>â€¢ To find the Rickest Rick in the multiverse who will know how to destroy it, <br/>
>
>â€¢ Long-term, unrestricted access to universe shattering tech & resources via Presidency of the Citadel. <br/>


## The Solution

<p><strong>Unlike Eyepatch Morty's method</strong> of finding valuable Rick's by catlouging how evil they are, I'm offerering a back-end system that will enable Eyepatch Morty to spot exploitable trends in every Rick's (and therefore Mortys') behaviour.</p>


<p>Not only will this assist Eyepatch Morty in locating the <em>"Rickest"</em> Rick by using data from beyond the fourth-wall, it will also give Eyepatch Morty the start he needs in his campaign for Presidency of the Citadel.</p>

## Project Goal

The ultimate goal of the project is to create a dashboard that;
>â€¢ Displays the latest number of Rick's & Morty's spotted alive, <br/>
>
>â€¢ Display their curent locations,<br/>
>
>â€¢ Display their location of origin,<br/>
>
>â€¢ Highlight Rick's of interest based on number of episode appearances.<br/>


## Personal Learning Objectives

After my graduation from a Data Engineering programme, I wanted to continue to reinforce and develop my skills (whilst still having some fun ðŸ¥³). With that, my aims are the following:

<ol>
<li>Develop an ETL pipeline independently
    <ul>
        <li>Write a python script that makes an API call to retrieve data,</li>
        <li>Removes un-wanted information using the Pandas library, and </li>
        <li>Persists the useful information to a relational database in normalised form.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Use a new (to me) data visualisation tool to create a meaningful dashboard.</li>

<li>Build an app that does not store sensitive information (such as passowrds) directly in an .env file.</li>

<li>Deepen my practical understanding of the role of APIs in production and micro-services so I can build one in my next mini-project.</li>
</ol>

## Tech Stack

â€¢ Python 3.10
